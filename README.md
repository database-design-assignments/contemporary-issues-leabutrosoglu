# Governments’ and Brokers’ Use of Data for Surveillance During Pandemic in 2020/2021
In this document, I discuss two articles about the governments’ and brokers’ use of data for surveillance during the pandemic of COVID-19, and the claims made by some that it plummets person privacy. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In New York Times’ [As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html), the author describes that through coronavirus surveillance, new forms of government snooping increase while tracking populations. In South Korea and Italy, when the pandemic began, the government started tracking and analyzing people by using digital surveillance tools such as their data transmitted by mobile phones. 

As the author states, “health and law enforcement authorities are understandably eager to employ every tool at their disposal to try to hinder the virus — even as the surveillance efforts threaten to alter the precarious balance between public safety and personal privacy on a global scale.” It is understood that while using location tracking and data for facial recognition in emergencies like COVID-19, privacy must be weighed against other important details such as saving lives. Saving lives is important, and it should be considered when weighting data privacy issues.

 
## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in New York Times, in another article published by the New York Times, [Intelligence Analysts Use U.S. Smartphone Location Data Without Warrants, Memo Says](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/dia-surveillance-data.html), the author describes that the government uses commercially available location data of people without their permission. When people go to testing sites for COVID-19, their phones’ App shares their location and it provides/sell it to brokers.

Mr. Wyden, in a Senate speech, stated: “…the government, instead of getting an order, just goes out and purchases the private records of Americans from these sleazy and unregulated commercial data brokers who are simply above the law.” According to him, this is unacceptable and goes against constitutional privacy rights. He added, “The Fourth Amendment is not for sale.” Further, now, with Mr. Biden in office, lawmakers are talking about putting new safeguards such as banning the “Section 215 to colleect web browsing information without a warrant.”
